## Step 4 - create private docker images

This is where we create the docker images that actually build tvheadend. Same image uploads those files to bintray.com.

### Overview

* Create private docker images to build the tvheadend APT packages for ubuntu
  * First create your 1 free private docker hub repo (you are only allowed 1)
    * So call it `dpi` - for 'Dockerhub Private Images' or something like that.
      * Create tagA named `tvh.build.ubuntu.master` --> builds docker image `tvh.build.ubuntu.master`
        * Point it to your bitbucket private repo
      * Create tagB named `tvh.build.ubuntu.stable` --> builds docker image `tvh.build.ubuntu.stable`
        * Point it to your bitbucket private repo

### Create new docker image on dockerhub

* Login to Dockerhub
  * Create new public repo named `dpi`, which is short for 'Docker Private Images'
  * We are only allowed 1 *private* repo for each dockerhub account.
    * As an automated build

![Dockerhub - Add Repository - Automated Build](_img/dh-add-repo-auto-build.png)

* Selected our private Bitbucket Repo where `tvh.ubuntu.build/master/Dockerfile` now exists with out bintray API key in it. e.g. `yourBitbucketUsername/dpi`

![Dockerhub - Automated Build - Select Github Repo](_img/dh-ab-select-bitbucket-private-repo.png)

* Now enter the details of the build.
  * Most important - set the repo's subfolder path to the Dockerfile. e.g. `tvh.ubuntu.build/master` AND `tvh.ubuntu.build/stable`
  * Because we are building 2 branches = 2 seperate docker images here.

![Dockerhub - Automated Build - Enter build details](_img/dh-add-private-auto-build.png)

  * Double check the Bitbucket repo from earlier for right `Dockerfile` location:

![BitBucket - Check dockerfile location](_img/bb-commit-bintray-api-key.png)

* The initial build should start automatically.
* Else just press the `Start Build` Button.

### Schedule a regular re-build

We do not need to rebuild the apt dependancies as often as tvheadend itself. Just once in a while, for example if ubuntu's ffmpeg version gets updated etc. I recommend a once-weekly or once-monthly build trigger.

We do this by setting up a small cron job on our local (developer) PC. Or any secure server that you have `ssh` login access to. Our cron script must be `chmod 700` as it contains in plaintext our Dockerhub API key. Which is needed for `curl`ing the build trigger rest api (it's just a webhook, like github webooks etc.)

* First we need to enable the build trigger in the dockerhub build setup:

![Dockerhub - Open build trigger](_img/dh-open-build-trigger.png)

![Dockerhub - Enable build trigger](_img/dh-enable-build-trigger.png)

* Now that we know the value for `$trigger_token`, we can log into our development PC or other always-connected server (as a regular user). To set up our cron job that triggers the rebuild every week or every month.

```sh
# Put here your REAL build trigger key, and write it to file
trigger_token="01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
dockerhub_repo="dpi"

# Create a chmod 600 file and copy your trigger key into it
mkdir -p $HOME/.cron.dockerhub.build/trigger.tokens
install --mode=0600 $HOME/.cron.dockerhub.build/trigger.tokens/${dockerhub_repo}
echo "$trigger_token" > $HOME/.cron.dockerhub.build/trigger.tokens/${dockerhub_repo}


# Download the cron script
mkdir -p $HOME/.cron.dockerhub.build/bin
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dreamcat4/docker-images/master/tvh.ubuntu.build/dh-trigger -o $HOME/.cron.dockerhub.build/bin/dh-trigger


# Manually test that the build trigger works:
# Run 1x & go check dockerhub 'Build details' pages.
# Argumments are your dockerhub username and the dockerhub repo name.
dh-trigger dreamcat4 ${dockerhub_repo}

# Create a cron job
crontab -e
>>>
# Rebuild at 03:17am every morning
17 3 * * * dh-trigger dreamcat4 dpi
<<<
```

***Note:***

You must allow / give reasonable amount of time **before** building this image, so that if it is a monday, the deps (dependancies) image can finish building first of all. If you check your other cron job, the suggest build start time for the public deps build was `02.17am` so here ^^ we specified `03.17am`. As the build tim may be approximately half an hour - we double that value to make sure. In case some days slow-down or longer build queues.

This build trigger will trigger all the `tags` (branches) of your `dpi` repo simultaneously. That is OK for tvhedend. As the master and stable branches to not depend upon each other and can be built at same time. However if you also have some other unrelated dpi images (extra tags) on your 1 free private repo you may not wish for every one of them to be re-build every night.

In which case the `dh-trigger` script could be modified to use an alternative dockerhub build trigger. Which can trigger each `tag` to build independantly of the other one. x2 one for stable, and one for master. Or else just create a machine account for the tveadhend builds. (rahter than using your own personal docker account).

### Enable email notification for failed builds

* On dockerhub
  * Go to: https://registry.hub.docker.com/account/notifications/
    * Enable the checkbox:
      * "Notify me when an automated build fails"
