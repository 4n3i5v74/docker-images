### Requirements

Needs `lxc-docker-1.5.0` (or higher). `crane 1.1.0` (or higher) is also recommended.

* This image `dreamcat4/pipework` requires the following docker run arguments: `--privileged=true`, `--pid=host`, `--net=host`, and `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock`. Or else pipework won't be able to set up networking on your other containers.

#### Docker 1.5.0 - from ubuntu testing repo

* Until docker-1.5 is officially released, it can be installed from docker's "ubuntu testing" apt repo with the following commands:
```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 \
  --recv-keys 740B314AE3941731B942C66ADF4FD13717AAD7D6
sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb https://test.docker.com/ubuntu docker main"
sudo apt-get install lxc-docker
```

This image will not work on any previous version of Docker before `1.5.0`. As the pipework script needs to see the host pid namespace, which requires `--pid=host` flag. The first version of Docker to implement this flag is Docker `1.5.0`.

#### Crane v1.1.0 or higher

[Crane](https://github.com/michaelsauter/crane/blob/master/README.md) is the recommended orchestration tool for running this docker image. You need a version of `crane`  which is [v1.1.0 or higher](https://github.com/michaelsauter/crane/releases/latest).

#### Docker Compose (Fig)

Does not work yet. See the [status](README.md#status) section.

They need to implement `--pid=host` flag. You may be able to add it yourself by building from source. If you know any python... sorry, no instructions provided here.
